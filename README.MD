The Refactored Battle Simulator project is a refactored version of a project I completed for my introductory programming class. 
The refactored version principally attempts to: 

1) Maintain seperation of concerns between classes
2) Adhere to D.R.Y. principles
3) Implement the original battle simulator project with an MVC architecture
